# Adventure-Game
This project takes you to Universal Studio by asking you directions and which theme you want to travel to. 

In custom.json file, it contains all the theme parks and directions where the users can move to in dictionaries. 

In adventure.py file, it loads the json file so that it prints out the directions and theme parks and saves the current place of the users until they arrive at the final destination.
